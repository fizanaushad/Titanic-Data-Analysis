# Titanic-Data-Analysis
# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis with Python

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical insights using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset used: [`train.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Source: Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

- Survival rate by gender, class, age, and embarkation port
- Box plots,histograms for age and fare distribution
- Correlation heatmap of features
- Cleaned missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Dropped sparse columns (Cabin)

## 📈 Key Insights

- Women had a much higher survival rate than men
- Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances
- Younger passengers and children were more likely to survive
- Higher ticket fare slightly correlated with survival
